# My_currency_To_text
## Description 
This is a c++ program to return the textual output for the corresponding input numeric currency. The project can rightly determine the textual output till 1 crore and a decimal precision up-to 2. Program will ask the user to enter a number and the expected output will be the text of corresponding currency. If a number is an integer then it will not return anything after decimal places whereas if the output is a double then it will return the paise corresponding to it divided by 100.
### Usage 
The software requirements include any c++ compiler such as devC++, codeblocks etc. Basic 2 libraries i.e the iostream library which is used to import some basic input and output streams. This library is accompained by the <bits/stdc++, which is a header file which I have included so as to use the inbuilt function fmod(), which returns the floating point remainder.
